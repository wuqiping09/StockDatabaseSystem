# StockDatabaseSystem
This is a mock stock database management system, which only considers basic stock transactions and does not consider stock's various complex situations in the real world.  

This system meets the following idealized assumptions:
1. The stock is added by the administrator, and the initial stock price is set by the administrator.
2. The stock cannot be deleted after it is added.
3. The administrator can set the stock price at any time.

The system mainly includes three modules:
1. account management
2. stock management
3. trading management
